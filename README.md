### WIP

### Future features:

- Save img
- Purchase img
- Offer price
- 3D View
- 3D All canvas view
- Use Diamond contracts
- Deploy to testnet not just locally
- Save current canvas to localStorage to prevent destructive view changes
- Toast events
- TESTS

### What is this?

Its a personal exploration of Solidity, ethers, & hardhat.

The idea is to save canvas data onchain, and view all the unique canvases and drawings saved.

It may spiral into something else, but for now, thats the initial idea!

### Some commands to help

yarn
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-X.ts --network localhost
yarn run dev
metamask -> advanced -> reset nonce data
