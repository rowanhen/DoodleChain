### What is this?

Its a personal exploration of Solidity, ethers, & hardhat.

The idea is to save canvas data onchain, and view all the unique canvases and drawings saved.

It may spiral into something else, but for now, thats the initial idea!

### Some commands to help

yarn
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-X.ts --network localhost
yarn run dev
